# Event Planner - Code

This directory contains the Python source code for the Student Society Event Planner.

## Files

- `event_planner.py` - Main program file with brute force and dynamic programming algorithms

## How to Run

```bash
python event_planner.py <input_file>
```

### Example:

```bash
python event_planner.py ../Input_Files/input_small.txt
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Standard library only (no external packages required)

## Implementation Status

This is the initial skeleton. The following functions need to be implemented:

- [ ] `read_input()` - Parse input files
- [ ] `brute_force_solver()` - Exhaustive search algorithm
- [ ] `dp_solver()` - Dynamic programming algorithm  
- [ ] `print_results()` - Format and display output
- [ ] `main()` - Coordinate the program flow

## Notes

- All code must be written without AI assistance per coursework guidelines
- Remember to add comments explaining algorithmic logic
- Test with all three provided input files (small, medium, large)
